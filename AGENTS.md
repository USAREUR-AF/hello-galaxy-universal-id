## What this repository is

hello-galaxy-universal-id demonstrates one portable identity descriptor that three platforms, which share nothing else, read and enforce in the same way.

It is one of the Hello Galaxy demonstrations: small, runnable examples, each showing one part of [goat](https://github.com/USAREUR-AF/goatcore). It holds no goat source code.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `bin/demo` | the whole demonstration |
| `bin/setup` | mints the throwaway certificate under `.cert/` |
| `lib/` | certificate, descriptor, document signature and registry code |
| `platforms/` | the three example platforms |
| `examples/raven-03.descriptor.json` | the committed descriptor that the demonstration must reproduce |
| `docs/` | background |

## Before you push

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs these. They need Python 3 and `openssl`.

```bash
python3 bin/demo
rm -rf .cert && python3 bin/setup
```

CI requires three lines in the output of `bin/demo`: `binding: VERIFIED`, `result matches committed examples/raven-03.descriptor.json: yes`, and `REJECTED  <- tamper caught`. A change to the descriptor format updates the committed example in the same pull request.

## Rules

1. **Nothing from a real deployment.** No hostname, domain, address, key or person of a real goatnet goes into a file or a commit message. Use made-up names, documentation addresses (RFC 5737) and `example.org` mail.
2. **Commits.** Conventional Commits subject of 100 characters or fewer, with a scope (`fix(<component>): …`). Every commit is signed off (`git commit -s`, the DCO) and signed with a key GitHub verifies. The organization's required check `verified-commits` refuses a pull request that holds an unverified commit.
3. **One logical change per pull request.**
4. **Vulnerabilities** go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never a public issue.

The contribution guide for goat as a whole is [goatcore CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/USAREUR-AF/goatcore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
